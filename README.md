# Weather-Prediction-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
Developed a CNN-based regression model to predict precipitation levels. Preprocessed and standardized numerical weather features for improved model performance. Designed and trained a deep learning model using Conv1D layers for feature extraction. Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE, achieving accurate precipitation predictions.
